_A short, text-based, adventure game (with an animated dungeon map)_

Welcome to TheCraving!

![](thecraving.gif)

The game will take you through a short series of "escape the room" scenarios
which are navigated by entering commands - e.g. `go north`. This is the first
game that I have ever built, so please pardon the simplicity and lack of story
depth. I had developed this as a fun way to test my [python] programming
skills at the time.

I truly appreciate all of you who take the time to play through the game. Any
and all feedback is _greatly_ appreciated. If you like the game, or at least
find it interesting, please share it with a friend and look for more projects
to follow!

## Requirements:

1. _**Python [3.9+]**_: Can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/).
1. _**Pygame**_: Installable via pip or downloaded [here](https://www.pygame.org/).

Originally built on 3.6 and updated later using 3.9 - older versions of python may work; however, this has not been tested.

## Instructions:

This game is intended to be run from the CLI. Once the necessary requirements
are installed (python and pygame), simply download the package and run
`.\src\thecraving.py` from the package directory.

**\*\*NOTE\*\*** \
_Users may need to run `python .\src\thecraving.py` depending on their config._

*Be sure to resize your window, or scroll up, upon starting the game!*\
Please make use of the in-game command `options` to view commands!\
Please make use of the in-game command `map` to view your current
location on the dungeon map! **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**
