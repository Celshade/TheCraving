\t**A bell sounds**
You awaken unto an empty white room..
..with no idea where you are or how you arrived.
You look around, searching for any clue of what's going on..
..but to no avail. All you see are white walls, a worn pack, and a strange orb.
You look down and check yourself..
..thankful that you're still, at least, in posession of your pants.

BETA_TEXT = """
You sigh, blissfully, as you eagerly unwrap the [Pack of Twizzlers]...
As the twizzlers hit your tastebuds, you feel a renewed surge of strength
well up within you. The room begins to come into focus as your eyes adjust
to the pitch darkness. An aged wooden door materializes just off to your left.
The door gives, easily, and you are temporarily blinded by sunshine pouring in
from the outside. You exit the compound unto a dense forest, when suddenly...

OMEGA_TEXT = """
You awaken, lying on your bed, with sunlight streaming in from
the windows to your left. You notice that your backpack is still slung across
your shoulders... You must have been so tired that you forgot to shrug it off.

That sound...that feeling...you recognize it..
\t..A cold realization sets in.
\n\t.. ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n
You've developed a serious craving for twizzlers.

You hear a distant rumble and the [White Orb] flares brilliantly...

A sealed ornate box sits atop an onyx pedestal.
Eight perfectly smooth, sphere-shaped, recesses encircle the box.
You notice each indent emitting a faint glow just like the orbs you carry...
"""

SHRINE_TEXT_BETA = """
You place each of the colored orbs in their corresponding niche.
The orbs pulse brightly, in sync, and the box unseals with a feint *hiss*.
